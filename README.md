# Docuflow

Doculow is a lightweight documentation generator from markdown files. It is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is a single binary that generates a static site from markdown files.

The build time of the site is very fast, as the markdown files are not parsed at build time. Instead, the markdown files are parsed at runtime, and the HTML is cached (or at least, it will be).

## Usage

### Development Testing

To test the site locally, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trevorflahardy/docuflow
cd docuflow
npm run build && node dist/index.js build --config ./docuflow.config.js
```

## Development Note

This side project of mine is in its infancy. I am currently working on the basic functionality of the site. This `README.md` will be updated as the project progresses.

The goal of this project is to write my own parser for Markdown files and to, eventually, extend conventional Markdown for useful purposes, such as inline evaluated code
blocks, variables, latex, etc.

### Development Goals

- [ ] Creating a CLI that loads from a settings file (`docuflkow.config.js`), copies all files to the output directory, and generates an `index.html` file.
- [ ] Conventional Markdown parsing
  - [x] Headers
  - [x] Paragraphs
  - [ ] Italic
  - [ ] Bold
  - [ ] Lists
  - [ ] Code blocks
  - [ ] Links (between MD files, need routing)
  - [ ] Images
  - [ ] MAYBE: Tables?
- [ ] Custom routing for links between MD files.
  - [ ] Links at headers for easy navigation.
- [ ] Custom Home Page capabilities? Maybe allow for a user to create an html or something?
- [ ] Documentation for docuflow generated by docuflow.
- [ ] Provide a user facing API of docuflow's internal API? (Maybe)
