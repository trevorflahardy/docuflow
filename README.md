# Docuflow

## Developer Note

Okay so the script is going to be held in the HTML. The script will parse the MD files as needed and render them.
Additionally, the docuflow.json file will be loaded into the server so it can be fetched by the client. Additionally,
all the MD files will be loaded into the server so they can be fetched by the client.

Later down on the road we'll do some tree building with modules so that everything is nice and organized,
and so hyperlinks between docs will work. The docuflow.json file in this root directory is for the docuflow
documentation itself.
