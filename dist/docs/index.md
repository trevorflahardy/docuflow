## Testing

### Italic Tests

This is a paragraph that *has some italic* text.
The paragraph can be two lines long, or really as many lines as you
are interested in.

*This paragraph* starts with italic text.

This paragraph ends with *italic text*.

This is a paragraph that has a random * in the middle, and thus cannot parse as an italic.
It spans multiple lines and has another * in the second line which voilates the law that the italics
must be on the same line.
