# Welcome to Docuflow!

Welcome to docuflow, a documentation site generator that uses markdown files to generate a static site.

## How does it Work?

Docuflow is based on Markdown and React, powered by Markdown (MD) and MDX (Markdown + JSX) files, which makes it easy not just to write and maintain your project's documentation,
but also to quickly and easily customize the look and feel of your documentation site.

In run time, docuflow parses the markdown files as needed and generates a static site that can be deployed to any static site hosting service. This means that the rendering of
the documentation is done client-side.

Docuflow is build on top of Vite, allowing for fast development and hot module reloading while developing your documentation. This makes it easy to see the changes you make in real time.
